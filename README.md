# Scroll-Mainnet-Guide-

First, to start our interaction in the Scroll Mainnet, we will need to add networks. You can do this [Here](https://scroll.io/portal). Everything is as usual, connect your wallet and add.

After that, we will need to replenish the Scroll Mainnet network itself for further vasodynamics, for this you can use the [official bridge](https://scroll.io/bridge) and also replenish the balance in native via third-party bridges by clicking on: [1](https://www.orbiter.finance/?source=Ethereum&dest=Scroll&token=ETH), [2](https://app.rhino.fi/bridge?token=ETH&chainOut=SCROLL&chain=ETHEREUM), [3](https://owlto.finance/bridge). For example, I'll choose bridge 2 now, because until November 14, replenishment to the Scroll network is free, only a gas transaction. To do this, go by clicking [HERE](https://app.rhino.fi/bridge?token=ETH&chainOut=SCROLL&chain=ETHEREUM)https://app.rhino.fi/bridge?token=ETH&chainOut=SCROLL&chain=ETHEREUM.

We connect our wallet, after which we will be asked to authorize the wallet on the site by signing two transactions

Next, choose the network you need and send the amount you want through the bridge, I will send from the main Ethereum Mainnet, but there are cheaper options such as Arbitrum. The minimum amount you can send is $1. The bridge will not allow you to send less than that, after signing the transaction, you can expect the funds to arrive in the Scroll Mainnet for further interactions.
-  What are the costs?
To send from the main Ether network at 6 gwei, the transaction will cost $1.2+-, so if possible, it is worth doing it before the gas rises and there is a good opportunity to top up your account for free.

After a successful transaction, you will see the following window

After replenishing the network, we need to somehow interact with the network, to do this, we go to [Syncswap](https://syncswap.xyz/scroll), connect the wallet and be sure to check the correctness of the connection network. Then everything is as usual, choose a comfortable amount to exchange and exchange it for different assets. You can also add liquidity to the pool in a pair, for example, ETH/USDC

Our next stop will be a swap meet called [Izumi](https://izumi.finance/home)

When you go to the site, you will be immediately asked to connect your wallet. The only difference is that transactions here will have to be approved. All other actions are the same as in the previous example.

For a change of pace, each of you can trade [NFTs](https://www.zkmarkets.com/scroll-mainnet) since the mainnet has just launched, I think there will be liquidity on the marketplace, so a smart mule would be wise to buy NFTs and earn further commissions on it.

There are a lot of activities on Scroll, but in this article we will analyze only the proven ones that I can recommend, and be sure that no one will catch you and you will not lose your own money. But to interact in other dapps that I have not mentioned in this article, the approach is as follows - Do Your Own Research. There is also an opportunity for those who like games to interact, click [HERE](https://www.omnikingdoms.io/). OmniKingdoms is a game in which to start our journey we need to press play, then connect our wallet, choose a character and come up with a nickname, but there is one very important BUT, the entrance to the game is not free, you will need to create your character for about $25 + a commission for creating a character around $5-6, so here at your own discretion.

And finally, we got to the activity without which no L2 network exists now, to be honest, I don't remember the turning point when [Domain](https://scrollns.com/) in the network became a must-have, but you can't go against the trend, and here Scroll launched its domain service where you can get your domain for a year for a small fee.
